This script simulates a deadlock condition on a network device by creating a situation where two processes compete for the same resources in a way that causes them to block each other indefinitely.

Important Note: This script is for educational purposes only. Creating deadlocks on production systems can cause service disruptions and should only be done in controlled test environments with proper authorization.


How This Script Works:

    It creates two threads that compete for two locks (lock1 and lock2) in opposite orders.

    Each thread attempts to make a network connection to the target device while holding one lock and trying to acquire the other.

    This creates the classic deadlock condition where:

        Thread1 holds lock1 and waits for lock2

        Thread2 holds lock2 and waits for lock1

    The script also attempts network connections to simulate resource contention on the target device.

Important Warnings:

    This script is for educational purposes only.

    Running this against systems without permission may be illegal.

    Deadlocks can cause service disruptions.

    Real network device deadlocks require specific conditions that vary by device and software.

For actual deadlock testing on network devices, you would need device-specific knowledge and typically use vendor-provided testing tools in a lab environment.
